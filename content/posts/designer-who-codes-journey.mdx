People often ask me whether I'm a "designer who codes" or a "developer who designs." The truth is, I'm both - and that's exactly the point. My journey from BSFA in Design to Senior UI Engineer has taught me that the most valuable place to be is right at the intersection.

## The Beginning: Pure Design

My career started in 2010 with a degree in Liberal Arts and Design from Valparaiso University. I was a classic designer - obsessed with typography, color theory, and pixel-perfect layouts. My tools were Adobe Creative Suite, sketch pads, and an endless supply of sticky notes.

For years, I created beautiful mockups and handed them off to developers. The process was... frustrating:

- "That's not technically feasible"
- "It would take 3 months to build that animation"
- "The design looks different on mobile"
- "We can't maintain that many custom components"

I realized I was designing in a vacuum, creating solutions without understanding the constraints of the medium.

## The Catalyst: Learning to Code

In 2019, I made a decision that changed my career trajectory: I enrolled in the University of Washington's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. At first, it was humbling. Here I was, a experienced designer, struggling with basic JavaScript concepts.

```javascript
// My first JavaScript function (yes, really)
function makeRed(element) {
  element.style.color = 'red';
}

// Me: "Wait, I can just... change styles with code?"
// Instructor: "..."
```

But something clicked. Suddenly, I understood why certain designs were "hard to implement." I could see the matrix.

## The Revelation: Design Systems

My first real engineering role at Cisco opened my eyes to the power of design systems. Here, my dual background became a superpower. I could:

- Talk to designers about component APIs in their language
- Explain to developers why consistent spacing matters
- Bridge the gap between Figma components and code components
- Advocate for both user needs AND technical constraints

I became the translator between two teams that often talked past each other.

## The Evolution: From UI to UX to Product

Each role taught me something new about the intersection of design and code:

### At University of Washington (Teaching)
Teaching forced me to articulate why certain patterns exist. Why do we use flexbox vs. grid? When should something be a controlled vs. uncontrolled component? Teaching developers made me a better developer.

### At Cisco (Design Systems)
I learned that the best design systems aren't just pretty - they're maintainable, performant, and flexible. My design background helped me understand the why behind the system, while my coding skills let me implement it effectively.

### At Swivel Finance (DeFi)
DeFi pushed me to design for trust and transparency. When users are trusting your interface with significant financial value, every pixel matters. But so does every millisecond of latency and every gas optimization.

### At Voltron Data (Current)
Building tools for data scientists and engineers requires deep technical understanding. I can't just make a pretty interface - I need to understand SQL, data pipelines, and performance implications of rendering millions of data points.

## The Unique Value Proposition

Here's what I've learned about being a designer-engineer hybrid:

### 1. Faster Iteration Cycles
When I have an idea, I can:
- Sketch it out
- Build a prototype
- Test with users
- Refine the design
- Ship to production

All without handoffs, meetings, or miscommunication.

### 2. Realistic Design Decisions
I never design something I can't build. This means:
- No impossible animations
- Considering performance from day one
- Understanding platform constraints
- Designing with real data, not lorem ipsum

### 3. Better Technical Decisions
My design background influences my code:
- Component APIs that feel intuitive
- Meaningful variable names
- Thoughtful error states
- Accessibility as a default, not an afterthought

### 4. Speaking Both Languages
In meetings, I can translate:
- "We need better affordances" → "Add hover states and cursor changes"
- "The time complexity is O(n²)" → "It'll feel sluggish with lots of items"
- "Increase the tap target" → "Min-height: 44px for mobile touch"

## The Challenges

It hasn't all been smooth sailing:

### Imposter Syndrome × 2
Some days I feel like I'm not a "real" designer because I don't use the latest Figma plugins. Other days I feel like I'm not a "real" engineer because I learned to code "late." The truth? I'm real at both.

### Depth vs. Breadth
There's always a tension between going deep in one area versus maintaining breadth. I've chosen strategic depth - deep enough to be dangerous in both, expert where they intersect.

### Tool Overwhelm
Keeping up with both design and development tools is exhausting. My solution? Focus on fundamentals over tools. Understanding flexbox deeply is more valuable than knowing every CSS framework.

## Advice for Aspiring Hybrids

### For Designers Learning to Code:

1. **Start with the basics**: HTML and CSS aren't "lesser" languages
2. **Build what you design**: Even if it's rough, implementation teaches you constraints
3. **Embrace the terminal**: Command line fluency opens doors
4. **Learn Git early**: Version control is a superpower
5. **Find developer mentors**: They'll accelerate your learning

### For Developers Learning Design:

1. **Study typography**: It's 95% of web design
2. **Learn color theory**: There's science behind good palettes
3. **Practice copywriting**: Interface text is part of design
4. **Use constraints**: Limitations breed creativity
5. **Seek feedback early**: Designers are trained to critique constructively

## The Future is Hybrid

I believe the future belongs to hybrid roles. As AI handles more boilerplate code and basic design tasks, the valuable work happens at the intersection:

- Understanding user needs AND technical possibilities
- Making thoughtful trade-offs between ideal and practical
- Communicating across disciplines
- Shipping holistic solutions, not just features

## My Current Workflow

Today, my process looks like:

1. **User Research**: Understanding the problem space
2. **Sketching**: Quick ideation on paper or iPad
3. **Prototyping**: Jump straight to code for interactive ideas
4. **Iteration**: Design and development happen simultaneously
5. **Polish**: Refine both the experience and the implementation

No handoffs. No miscommunication. No "lost in translation."

## Conclusion

Being a designer who codes (or a developer who designs) isn't about being equally expert at both. It's about being fluent enough in both languages to have meaningful conversations and make informed decisions.

My design background makes me a better engineer. My engineering skills make me a better designer. But most importantly, having both perspectives makes me a better product builder.

To those sitting on the fence: jump in. The water's fine on both sides, and the view from the bridge is spectacular.

What's your experience bridging disciplines? Are you a specialist who's curious about the other side, or a generalist finding your niche? I'd love to hear your story.
