If you're using AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, or Aider, you've probably felt the frustration of being limited to working on one feature at a time. You're in the middle of debugging a critical issue when inspiration strikes for a new feature, but switching contexts means losing your flow on both fronts.

Git worktrees solve this elegantly, letting you run multiple AI agents simultaneously on different branches of the same codebase. Here's how to set up a workflow that will transform your development productivity.

## The Problem: Context Switching Kills Flow

Traditional Git workflow forces you into this cycle:
1. Working on Feature A
2. Critical bug discovered
3. `git stash` your work
4. `git checkout` bug-fix branch
5. Fix bug, commit, switch back
6. `git stash pop` and try to remember where you were

With AI assistants, this is even more painful because you lose the context of your conversation, the current state of your debugging session, or the momentum of your feature development.

## The Solution: Git Worktrees + Parallel AI Sessions

Git worktrees let you have multiple working directories from the same repository, each on different branches. Combined with AI coding assistants, this creates a powerful parallel development environment.

## Setting Up Your Multi-Pronged Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Repository Setup

Start from your main repository:

```bash
# Navigate to your main project
cd /path/to/your-project

# Create your first branch (bug fix)
git checkout -b bugfix/user-authentication

# Create a worktree for feature development
git worktree add ../your-project-feature feature/dashboard-redesign
```

Now you have:
- `./your-project/` → `bugfix/user-authentication` branch
- `../your-project-feature/` → `feature/dashboard-redesign` branch

### Step 2: Terminal and Editor Setup

**Terminal Session 1 (Bug Fix):**
```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
# Start your AI assistant
cursor .  # or code . for VS Code
# In terminal: aider, or claude-code, etc.
```

**Terminal Session 2 (Feature Development):**
```bash
cd /path/to/your-project-feature
# Start another AI assistant instance
cursor .  # Opens in separate window
# In terminal: another aider session, etc.
```

### Step 3: Parallel Development

Now you can:
- Debug authentication issues in one window while building dashboard features in another
- Run different development servers on different ports
- Have distinct AI conversation contexts for each problem
- Commit to either branch independently without losing context

## Real-World Workflow Example

Here's how this looks in practice:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Bug fixing session
cd ~/projects/myapp
git checkout -b hotfix/login-redirect
cursor .
# Start Claude Code or Aider focused on the login bug

# Terminal 2: Feature development  
cd ~/projects/myapp-feature
git worktree add . feature/user-dashboard
cursor .
# Start another AI session focused on dashboard development

# Terminal 3: Maybe even a third worktree for refactoring
cd ~/projects/myapp-refactor  
git worktree add . refactor/api-cleanup
cursor .
```

Each session maintains its own:
- File watchers and dev servers
- AI conversation context
- Uncommitted changes
- Testing environment

## Advanced Tips

### Branch Management
```bash
# Create branch and worktree in one command
git worktree add -b feature/new-api ../project-api

# List all your active worktrees
git worktree list

# See which branches exist
git branch -a
```

### Development Server Management
```bash
# Terminal 1: Main app on port 3000
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Feature branch on port 3001  
npm run dev -- --port 3001

# Terminal 3: API work on port 8000
npm run api:dev
```

### AI Assistant Coordination
- Use descriptive branch names that help AI understand context
- Start each AI session with a brief explanation of what you're working on
- Use commit messages to help AI understand the progression

## Benefits of This Approach

**Maintain Flow State**: Never lose momentum switching between tasks

**Context Preservation**: Each AI session maintains awareness of its specific problem domain

**Parallel Testing**: Run different test suites simultaneously

**Risk Isolation**: Experimental features don't interfere with critical bug fixes

**Faster Iteration**: Compare approaches by having them side-by-side

## Cleanup and Best Practices

### Before Removing Worktrees
Always commit your work first:

```bash
# In each worktree directory
git add .
git commit -m "Your progress so far"

# Optionally push to backup remotely
git push origin feature/dashboard-redesign
```

### Removing Worktrees
```bash
# From your main repository
git worktree remove ../your-project-feature

# The branch still exists with all commits
git branch -a  # You'll see feature/dashboard-redesign

# Recreate worktree anytime
git worktree add ../project-feature-v2 feature/dashboard-redesign
```

### Managing Multiple Worktrees
```bash
# Quick status check across all worktrees
git worktree list

# Clean up unused worktrees
git worktree prune
```

## When to Use This Approach

This workflow shines when you're:
- Working on multiple unrelated features
- Handling urgent bugs while developing features  
- Experimenting with different approaches to the same problem
- Collaborating with AI on complex, multi-faceted projects
- Managing both frontend and backend changes simultaneously

## Conclusion

Git worktrees unlock a new level of productivity when combined with AI coding assistants. Instead of being forced into linear development, you can tackle multiple problems simultaneously while maintaining the full context and flow state that makes AI collaboration so powerful.

Try this approach on your next project - you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.
