# Markdown to Slides

Transform markdown documents into professional presentation slides with AI-powered layout and design optimization.

## Features

- **Intelligent Slide Breaks**: AI determines optimal content distribution
- **Layout Optimization**: Automatically chooses best layouts for content types
- **Theme Generation**: AI-suggested themes based on content analysis
- **Interactive Elements**: Convert lists to animations and transitions
- **Export Options**: PDF, PowerPoint, HTML, and web-hosted presentations

## How It Works

**Input**: Standard markdown with headers, lists, code blocks, and images
**Processing**: AI analyzes content structure and generates slide layouts
**Output**: Professional presentation with optimized visual hierarchy

## Content Analysis

The AI identifies and optimizes:
- **Title Slides**: H1 headers become section dividers
- **Content Slides**: H2/H3 headers with supporting content
- **List Presentations**: Bullet points with progressive disclosure
- **Code Demonstrations**: Syntax-highlighted code with explanations
- **Image Layouts**: Optimal image placement and sizing

## Example Transformation
