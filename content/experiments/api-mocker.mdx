# API Mocker

Generate realistic mock APIs with intelligent data relationships using natural language descriptions.

## Features

- **Schema-Free Setup**: Describe endpoints in plain English
- **Intelligent Data Generation**: AI creates realistic, related data
- **Relationship Mapping**: Automatically handles foreign keys and references
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON, GraphQL, REST endpoints
- **Real-time Updates**: Live API available instantly

## How It Works

Simply describe your API needs:
- "User management system with profiles and posts"
- "E-commerce API with products, orders, and inventory"
- "Social media API with users, posts, comments, and likes"

The AI generates:
- Realistic field names and data types
- Proper relationships between entities
- Consistent data patterns
- Appropriate HTTP methods and status codes

## Example Generation

Input: "Blog API with authors and posts"

Generated endpoints:
```
GET /api/authors
GET /api/authors/:id
GET /api/posts
GET /api/posts/:id
GET /api/authors/:id/posts
POST /api/posts
PUT /api/posts/:id
DELETE /api/posts/:id
```

With realistic data:
```json
{
  "author": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "email": "sarah.chen@example.com",
    "bio": "Tech writer and developer",
    "joined": "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Tech Stack

- Express.js for API hosting
- OpenAI API for data generation
- Faker.js for realistic data
- JSON Server for quick deployment

## Use Cases

- Frontend development without backend
- API design prototyping
- Integration testing
- Demo applications

Perfect for developers who need realistic mock data without manual JSON creation.
