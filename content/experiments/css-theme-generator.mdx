Built this in 2 hours with Claude's help to solve a recurring problem: clients who have "a brand color" but need a complete design system. The tool generates a full CSS theme with proper color scales, semantic tokens, and accessibility checks.

## How It Works

1. **Input a single hex color** - Your brand's primary color
2. **AI generates complementary colors** - Using color theory algorithms
3. **Automatic scale generation** - Creates 10 shades (50-900) for each color  
4. **Semantic token mapping** - Maps colors to purpose (primary, success, warning, etc.)
5. **Copy-paste CSS** - Get variables ready for your project

## Key Features

- **WCAG contrast checking** - Ensures text/background combinations are accessible
- **Multiple export formats** - CSS variables, Sass, JSON tokens
- **Real-time preview** - See your theme applied to common UI components
- **Color blindness simulation** - Check how your palette appears to all users

## AI Integration

Used Claude to implement the color theory algorithms. The trickiest part was generating perceptually uniform color scales - traditional HSL manipulation creates muddy mid-tones. Claude helped implement a LAB color space approach that maintains vibrancy across the scale.

```javascript
// Claude-assisted perceptual scaling
function generateColorScale(baseColor, steps = 10) {
  const lab = hexToLab(baseColor);
  const scale = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
    const lightness = 95 - (i * 9); // Even distribution
    scale.push(labToHex({
      ...lab,
      l: lightness
    }));
  }
  
  return scale;
}
```

## Learnings

- Color math is harder than it looks
- Accessibility should be built-in, not bolted on
- Real-time feedback dramatically improves UX
- AI excels at implementing complex algorithms from descriptions

This experiment led to a consulting project where I built a custom theme generator for a design system. Sometimes the best portfolio pieces are tools that solve your own problems!
