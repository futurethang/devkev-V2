# SQL Optimizer

Analyze and optimize SQL queries with AI-powered performance suggestions and detailed explanations.

## Features

- **Query Analysis**: Deep analysis of SQL structure and performance patterns
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Specific recommendations for improvement
- **Performance Metrics**: Estimated execution time and resource usage
- **Index Recommendations**: Suggested indexes for better performance
- **Query Rewriting**: Alternative query structures that perform better

## Optimization Categories

**Indexing**:
- Missing index identification
- Composite index suggestions
- Unused index detection

**Query Structure**:
- JOIN optimization
- Subquery to JOIN conversion
- WHERE clause improvements

**Performance Patterns**:
- N+1 query detection
- Inefficient LIKE patterns
- Unnecessary DISTINCT usage

## Example Optimization

**Original Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users u
WHERE u.email LIKE '%@gmail.com%'
AND u.created_at > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY u.name;
```

**AI Analysis**:
- ⚠️ `LIKE '%@gmail.com%'` prevents index usage
- ⚠️ `SELECT *` retrieves unnecessary columns
- ⚠️ Missing index on `created_at`
- ⚠️ ORDER BY may require filesort

**Optimized Query**:
```sql
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email, u.created_at 
FROM users u
WHERE u.email LIKE '%@gmail.com'
AND u.created_at > '2023-01-01'
AND u.created_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY u.name;
```

**Recommended Indexes**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_created_name ON users(created_at, name);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_suffix ON users(email) WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

## Supported Databases

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQL Server
- Oracle
- SQLite

## Tech Stack

- Node.js with SQL parsing libraries
- OpenAI API for optimization analysis
- Database-specific query planners
- Performance metrics calculation

## Use Cases
