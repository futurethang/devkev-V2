## Overview

As Senior UX Engineer at Swivel Finance, I led the front-end development of a decentralized fixed-rate lending protocol interface. The challenge was making complex DeFi mechanics accessible to both crypto natives and traditional finance users.

## Key Contributions

### üß© Web Components Architecture

Chose Web Components for true framework agnosticism and long-term maintainability:

```javascript
// Custom element for yield curve visualization
class YieldCurve extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  }
  
  connectedCallback() {
    this.render();
    this.subscribeToMarketData();
  }
  
  render() {
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        :host {
          display: block;
          /* Encapsulated styles */
        }
      </style>
      <canvas id="curve"></canvas>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('yield-curve', YieldCurve);
```

### üí± Complex Financial Interactions

Designed intuitive interfaces for sophisticated financial operations:

- **Order book visualization** for fixed-rate markets
- **Position management** dashboard with P&L tracking
- **Liquidity provision** flows with impermanent loss warnings
- **Multi-step transaction** flows with clear state management

### üîê Security-First Design

In DeFi, security and transparency are paramount:

- Clear transaction previews before wallet signing
- Real-time slippage protection indicators
- Educational tooltips for every financial term
- Prominent risk warnings for volatile positions

## Technical Challenges

### Real-Time Data Synchronization

DeFi protocols require constant synchronization with blockchain state:

```typescript
class MarketDataSync {
  private provider: ethers.Provider;
  private contracts: Map<string, Contract>;
  
  async syncMarketData() {
    // Subscribe to blockchain events
    this.contracts.forEach((contract, name) => {
      contract.on('MarketUpdate', this.handleMarketUpdate);
      contract.on('OrderFilled', this.handleOrderFilled);
    });
  }
  
  handleMarketUpdate = async (event: MarketUpdateEvent) => {
    // Update UI with new rates
    this.broadcastUpdate({
      market: event.market,
      rate: event.rate,
      volume: event.volume
    });
  };
}
```

### Gas Optimization UI

Created interfaces that help users optimize transaction costs:

- Gas price recommendations based on network congestion
- Batch transaction suggestions
- Clear cost breakdowns in USD equivalent

## Design Philosophy

### Bridging TradFi and DeFi

Many Swivel users came from traditional finance backgrounds. The UI needed to speak both languages:

- Familiar trading interfaces with order books and charts
- Clear mappings between DeFi terms and TradFi equivalents
- Professional, Bloomberg-terminal-inspired aesthetics
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Progressive Disclosure

Complex features revealed gradually as users gained expertise:

1. **Beginner**: Simple lend/borrow interface
2. **Intermediate**: Market making and yield strategies
3. **Advanced**: Arbitrage tools and API access

## Results & Impact

During my tenure at Swivel:

- üìä **TVL Growth**: Platform grew from $0 to $25M+ Total Value Locked
- üë• **User Adoption**: 5,000+ active users across 40+ countries
- üèÜ **Industry Recognition**: Featured in DeFi Pulse and The Defiant
- ‚ö° **Performance**: 98+ Lighthouse score maintained

## Lessons in DeFi UX

### Trust Through Transparency

In DeFi, users need to understand exactly what's happening with their funds:

- Show all fees upfront
- Explain smart contract interactions
- Provide transaction history with Etherscan links
- Never hide risks or potential losses

### Accessibility Matters

Made the platform usable for users with varying technical backgrounds:

- Comprehensive onboarding flows
- In-context education
- Fallback options for Web3 wallet issues
- Clear error messages with actionable solutions

## Technical Stack

- **Web Components** with TypeScript
- **Lit** for reactive components
- **ethers.js** for blockchain interaction
- **D3.js** for financial visualizations
- **Storybook** for component documentation

## Reflection

Working at Swivel taught me how to balance innovation with usability in the fast-paced DeFi space. The Web Components approach proved valuable for long-term maintainability and allowed other teams to integrate our components regardless of their framework choices.
