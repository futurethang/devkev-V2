This portfolio site itself is a demonstration of AI-first development. Built entirely through conversation with Claude Code, it showcases:

- Semantic HTML structure for AI parsing
- Theme-agnostic CSS architecture
- Type-safe content management with Contentlayer
- Optimized for both human visitors and AI crawlers

The entire codebase was generated through natural language prompts, demonstrating the power of AI-augmented development.
