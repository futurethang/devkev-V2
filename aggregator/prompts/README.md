4. Compare system vs user message approaches

#### Claude Console (Anthropic)
1. Test same prompts for comparison
2. Evaluate structured output quality
3. Test reasoning capabilities
4. Compare focus area adherence

#### Other Platforms
- **LangSmith**: For prompt versioning and A/B testing
- **Weights & Biases**: For performance tracking
- **PromptBase**: For discovering proven patterns

### 2. Sample Content Creation

Create test sets from real aggregator feeds:
```bash
# Generate sample content for testing
npm run aggregator:sample-content
```

### 3. Performance Evaluation

Track metrics across all prompt types:
- **Quality**: Accuracy, relevance, usefulness
- **Consistency**: Variation across multiple runs
- **Format**: Parsing success and structure compliance
- **Focus Alignment**: Adherence to focus area requirements

## üîß Implementation Integration

### File Locations
- **Base Provider**: `aggregator/lib/ai/providers/base-provider.ts`
- **AI Processor**: `aggregator/lib/ai/ai-processor.ts`
- **Content Processor**: `aggregator/lib/processing/content-processor.ts`

### Usage Examples

#### Summarization
```typescript
const summary = await aiProvider.generateSummary(
  content, 
  "AI-powered product development"
)
```

#### Relevance Scoring
```typescript
const score = await aiProvider.calculateSemanticRelevance(
  content,
  "Machine learning engineering and MLOps"
)
```

#### Tag Generation
```typescript
const tags = await aiProvider.generateTags(
  content,
  existingTags
)
```

#### Insights Extraction
```typescript
const insights = await aiProvider.extractInsights(
  content,
  "Design systems and component libraries"
)
```

## üöÄ Optimization Workflow

### Phase 1: Baseline Documentation ‚úÖ
- [x] Extract current prompts into organized files
- [x] Document performance metrics and examples
- [x] Create testing framework documentation

### Phase 2: Sample Content Creation
- [ ] Generate representative content samples from feeds
- [ ] Create gold standard test sets with expert annotations
- [ ] Balance content across focus areas and difficulty levels

### Phase 3: External Platform Testing
- [ ] Set up OpenAI Playground templates
- [ ] Create Claude Console workbooks
- [ ] Test prompt variations systematically
- [ ] Document performance across platforms

### Phase 4: Optimization & Integration
- [ ] Implement best-performing prompt variations
- [ ] Add prompt versioning system
- [ ] Update integration points
- [ ] Deploy and monitor improvements

## üìà Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Improved Relevance Detection**: Better article filtering for focus areas
2. **Higher Summary Quality**: More accurate and useful content summaries
3. **Enhanced Tag Precision**: Better categorization and searchability
4. **More Actionable Insights**: Practical takeaways for readers

### Measurement Approach
- **A/B Testing**: Compare old vs new prompts on real content
- **Expert Evaluation**: Domain expert quality ratings
- **User Feedback**: Newsletter reader engagement metrics
- **System Metrics**: Processing time, API costs, error rates

## üîÑ Version Control

### Prompt Versioning
- Each prompt file includes version history
- Breaking changes documented with migration notes
- Performance comparisons between versions
- Rollback procedures for failed optimizations

### Testing Before Deployment
- Validate on sample content before production
- Measure performance impact on system metrics
- Monitor API cost implications
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible

## üí° Contributing

### Adding New Prompts
1. Create detailed documentation following existing templates
2. Include multiple variation examples
3. Define success metrics and test cases
4. Test on sample content before integration

### Optimizing Existing Prompts
